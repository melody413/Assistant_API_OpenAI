/**
 * API Route - Check Run Status
 *
 * This route is designed to check the status of a specific run in a thread
 * using the OpenAI API. It accepts POST requests containing 'threadId' and
 * 'runId' in the form data. The route then queries the OpenAI API to retrieve
 * the current status of the specified run. This information is crucial for
 * understanding the state of an ongoing interaction with an AI assistant,
 * such as whether the interaction is completed, ongoing, or has encountered
 * any issues. The status of the run is returned as a JSON response, providing
 * a simple and effective way for client applications to monitor and react to
 * the progress of AI-assisted conversations or tasks.
 *
 * Path: /api/checkRunStatus
